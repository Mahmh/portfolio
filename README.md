# Portfolio Website
This repository contains the open-source code for my personal portfolio website. This website showcases my skills, projects, experience, and certifications in full-stack web development and AI engineering.

It uses Vite, Nginx, and FastAPI. Every time I update the code and upload it to this GitHub repository, it automatically syncs and uploads the changes to my hosting provider (Hostinger), via GitHub Actions.
